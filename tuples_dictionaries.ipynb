    "Hi all, i'm kim pham and i'm here to give you a primer on programming in python. Believe it or not, i'm a librarian, actually the physics librarian here at utsc, which might seem strange to you that i'm teaching you how to code. Personally, I am by no means an expert coder but I do get to code from time to time in my work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library and the librarians including myself are available to help you with what you might think of as traditional library help such as finding research materials such as journal articles and books (both online or in print), we can show you how to use online databases, help to critically evaluate media and information sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now If I were to generalize our services further, we're available to help you develop the skills to understand data and information to perform tasks in digital environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so in this case, this includes teaching you how to code, because coding involves understanding how to use and manipulate data and then trying to automate the tasks of working with that data (see a definition of digital literacy, http://connect.ala.org/node/181197). So now that you know why I'm here, lets get started.\n",

    "You can find programs everywhere. Every time you use a web browser, play a video game or use an app on your mobile device, and as you will get to try out when you're driving a car, you're using a program. Even your operating system, such as OSX, Linux or Windows is a program. And so, a program is just a set of instructions that is run or executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programs run on devices that are capable of processing code. This includes hardware, like a mobile device, or your laptop, or a tablet. But programs can also be run by other programs. This is what happens when you play a game in a web browser. Your web browser knows how to run programs written in a programming language called Javascript. \n",
